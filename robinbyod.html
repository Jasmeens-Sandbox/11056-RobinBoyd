                        <p>Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and internationally renowned
                            architect.
                            He was also widely published and appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd,
                            Roy
                            Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the practice of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd which became
                            a
                            leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, the firm maintained a strong
                            design
                            unity. Some buildings revealed the hand of one or other of the architects, but in general
                            the
                            firm developed a corporate style, combining the philosophies of the trio and representing
                            the
                            advanced thinking of that era. They often worked or supervised on each other’s projects.
                            Their
                            work was a distinctive Australian form of the International Style, then called Contemporary.

                        <p>Boyd joined the National Capital Planning Committee (NCPC) in January 1968 as one of two
                            architectural experts, the other being Professor Gordon Stephenson from Western Australia.
                            Boyd
                            and Stephenson were charged with creating a statement of civic design philosophy that would
                            form
                            the basis of the NCDC policies relating to the Buildings (Design and Siting) Ordinance 1964.
                            These policies would guide the aesthetic, development principles and layout of buildings in
                            the
                            National Capital areas of Canberra.</p>
                        <p>Boyd had a prolific output of architectural designs, books and articles. He wrote over 700
                            articles for journals and newspapers, presented a TV series on Modernism and was the author
                            of
                            Victorian Modern: 111 Years of modern Architecture in the State of Victoria, Australia
                            (1947);
                            Australia’s Home: Its Origins, Builders and Occupiers (1952); The Australian Ugliness
                            (1960);
                            Kenzo Tange (1962); The Walls Around Us: The Story of Australian Architecture (1962); The
                            Puzzle
                            of Architecture (1965); New Directions in Japanese Architecture (1968); Living In Australia
                            (1970); and The Great Great Australian Dream (1972 posthumously). </p>

                        <p>His architectural work is mostly known through his residential designs. He was known for his
                            ability to design houses that would meet client needs, solve site problems and still retain
                            architectural integrity. The designs were heavily influenced by the functional and
                            international
                            styles of architecture and became known as the Melbourne Regional style. It was light,
                            simple
                            and elegant and unmistakably modern. (Architecture Today 1972; Saunders 1972; and Serle
                            1995)
                        </p>

                        <p>Boyd’s residential designs that are registered on the ACT Heritage Register include:</p>

                            <li>Manning Clark’s House, 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest (1952);</li>

                        <p>In the 1960s he started to move away from the glass box functionalism of the International
                            and
                            Melbourne Regional styles arguing that it had a limited range of expression and instead
                            tried,
                            somewhat unsuccessfully, to land large prestigious commissions for advanced high-rise
                            buildings.
                            He submitted many designs, but few were successful. Those that he did win tended to be of a
                            more
                            moderate size, such as the Menzies College at La Trobe University or Churchill House. Taylor
                            (1990:80) notes that Boyd’s interest in Brutalism was heavily influenced by his travels in
                            Japan
                            and he became known as the chief advocate in Australia for the “vigorous, concrete buildings
                            of
                            post-war Japan”, but goes on to note that his own attempts at major Brutalist designs show
                            “...a
                            somewhat crude, unexpressive, Brutalist aesthetic.</p>

                        <p>Boyd’s later buildings are disappointing...”. Commentary in architectural journals and works
                            on
                            Boyd focus on his residential designs and larger Melbourne-based buildings. References to
                            Churchill House mention that he was working on it at the time of his death, and the most
                            favourable account comes from Serle’s 1995 biography that noted that it was the “only new
                            work
                            of any consequence” (p.308) and that tenders for “Boyd’s innovative design for Churchill
                            House
                            were surprisingly low” (p.309). Raisebeck (2017) noted that, “...Boyd’s works and writings
                            from
                            1960- 1967 depict a relatively consistent commitment to a universal modernism tempered
                            through a
                            regional lense...exemplified in the earlier Zoology building”, while his later work
                            demonstrates
                            a stark change of focus and a less coherent whole with the different façades of Churchill
                            House
                            showing a different compositional treatment as a result of “...Boyd’s experimental bent and
                            abandonment of an integrated and universal modernism.”</p>

                        <p>Boyd received the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1969 and was awarded
                            a
                            Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1971 for his services
                            to
                            architecture and government. In the same year he died suddenly from a stroke while
                            recovering
                            from an anaesthetic as part of treatment for an infection. As a result, his work on the
                            Former
                            Churchill House had to be completed by another architect, Bill Williams, who had been
                            employed
                            by Boyd to work on the project under the supervision of a more experienced architect, Neil
                            Clerehan (who later designed the second storey of the north wing to replace the glass
                            display
                            pavilion). (Serle 1995)</p>

                                Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed
                                by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia
                                in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s
                                last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is
                                one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was
                                Canberra’s first brutalist building.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east
                                and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central
                                pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with
                                the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool.
                                The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift
                                tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are
                                two storeyed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the
                                building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its
                                large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping
                                structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels,
                                precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows.
                                Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with
                                the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron
                                Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.

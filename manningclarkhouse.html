                        <p>The Manning Clark House, at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952
                            for Professor and Mrs Manning Clark. The house is typical of the post-war Melbourne regional
                            style and Boyd’s Peninsula House Design, with its low pitched gable roof, widely projecting
                            eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes an interesting comparison with the
                            nearby Fenner House, also designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance
                            gallery joining two wings of the house.</p>

                        <p> The late Professor Manning Clark is probably the most influential and well known Australian
                            historian and virtually all of his published work was written in the study of this house. He
                            is best known for his epic History of Australia, published in six volumes from 1962 and
                            1987. Manning Clark House was established as an incorporated association in 1998 by Dymphna
                            Clark, to serve the intellectual and cultural interests of the nation.</p>

                        <h2 class="article__subtitle">Architectural Significance</h2>
                        <p>The Clark House at 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest, is listed on the ACT Chapter of the
                            Australian Institute of Architects Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture.
                            It is regarded by the AIA as being an innovative design solution to the specific
                            requirements of Professor Manning Clark and a very good example of the Melbourne regional
                            style of Robin Boyd, a leading figure in post-war Australian architecture.</p>

                        <h2 class="article__subtitle">Clark House Plan: The Original Floorplan</h2>
                        <p>The house has great significance for its association with Professor Manning Clark. The
                            efforts of the Manning Clark House organisation will ensure that the house is conserved and
                            made available to future generations of Australians for cultural pursuits.</p>

                        <h2 class="article__subtitle">Description of the House</h2>
                        <p>The house is sited along the high side of a north sloping block, taking advantage of the
                            north aspect and outlook to the well laid out garden. The house is of simple masonry
                            construction, with bagged walls painted light grey with charcoal trim, timber framed windows
                            and metal deck roof. </p>

                        <p>Two separate parallel wings divide the living and sleeping areas, which are connected by a
                            glass walled passage and entrance. Either side of this passage is a courtyard, one facing
                            north and the other (the main entrance) facing south. The walls of the south courtyard are
                            brick grills, screening the windows of the bathroom on one side and the laundry on the
                            other. Similar brick grill detailing can be seen on the Melbourne regional style Forrest
                            Townhouses and 4 Cobby Street (both by Roy Grounds).</p>

                        <p>Positioned over the entrance is the study, which meets Manning Clark’s original requirements
                            for an isolated work area. Access to the study is by a very steep flight of steps. The study
                            contains a large portion of Manning Clark’s extensive library and is a significant element
                            of the house.</p>
                        <p>The living room, study and two bedrooms face north and have an outlook through big windows
                            shielded by white louvred eaves. The living area incorporates the dining room and kitchen
                            under the pitched roof which slopes upwards, following the stepped-up level of the kitchen
                            and adjacent laundry and utility room. The exposed beams of the ceiling were originally
                            painted white against a galah pink ceiling, while the unplastered brick walls were painted
                            grey.</p>
                        <p>Only minor alterations have been made to house. A pergola was added to extend the sunshade
                            over the north facing windows of the study and a carport was built on to the side of the
                            house near the entry area. The house is in excellent condition.</p>

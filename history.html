                        <p>Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust
                            began consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building
                            committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the current
                            site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.
                        </p>
                        <p>The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental
                            office accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust.
                            Features of the original design included:</p>

                            <li>a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a

                            <li>the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace;

                            <li>accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar

                        <p class="animate">The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was officially
                            opened on 14 April 1972.</p>
                        <p class="animate">Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the
                            Trust as its site representative to replace Boyd.</p>
                        <p class="animate">Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted Australian architect. Boyd was a
                            member of a prominent artistic family, and combined a career as an architect, author and
                            critic (Clerehan 1993). He was strongly influenced by the Modern Movement, and deeply
                            interested in the development of Australian architecture. Boyd is often remembered best for
                            his domestic architecture, as well as his books, but he also produced designs for larger
                            scale works, such as in the case of Churchill House. Boyd was awarded the Gold Medal by the
                            RAIA in 1969, and made an honorary fellow in 1970.</p>
                        <p class="animate">Boyd was strongly influenced later in his career by the post-war concrete
                            architecture produced in Japan (Taylor 1990:80). This Brutalist style is evident in the
                            design for Menzies College Student Housing (1968) and in the design for Churchill House. In
                            this latter phase, Boyd was seeking larger scale projects, although with only limited
                            success.

                        <p class="animate">Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late
                            Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include:</p>
                        <ul class="article__list animate">
                            <li>National Gallery of Australia, 1971;</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p class="animate">Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two
                            examples of an office building. While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than
                            an aesthetic (Banham 1966:10), both office buildings display a more restrained form compared
                            to the other buildings, several of which were intended to portray a distinctive image in the
                            national capital.</p>

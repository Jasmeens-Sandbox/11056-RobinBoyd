                        <p class="animate">
                            Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill
                            Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70 and construction was completed in
                            1971. The building is an example of the Late Twentieth-Century Brutalist
                            Style (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form concrete.
                        </p>

                        <p class="animate">
                            The complex comprises a number of components: the main building with its
                            east and south wings, the separate north wing or pavilion, the pool and
                            the rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape in plan, and with
                            the north wing it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the pool
                            is located. The main building is of three storeys with a four storey
                            lift tower at the southeast corner, the north wing is of two storeys,
                            and the carpark is two storeyed.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="article__subtitle animate">Main Building</h2>
                        <p class="animate">
                            The main building displays several different elevational treatments. The
                            elevations facing onto the pool area feature floor to ceiling glass with
                            minimal black metal frames to the lowest level, and precast vertical
                            panels on the upper two storeys. Each panel has a projecting fin and are
                            relatively narrow, with the overall affect being of closely spaced
                            vertical fins. Beside the fins are narrow, slot windows providing
                            minimal outlook onto the pool area.
                        </p>

                        <p class="animate">
                            The south and east elevations are quite different in character having
                            long horizontal sections of flush-mounted glazing set in minimal black
                            metal frames, with timber-textured off-form concrete spandrels between
                            storeys. The base course of the elevation is a large section
                            black-coated steel beam. Several window-mounted airconditioners are
                            located on the south elevation. The blank end walls of the wings and the
                            lift tower are off-form, timber-textured concrete with incised storey
                            lines.

                            At the junction of the two wings are the foyers for each floor as well
                            as the service core including the lift. Apart from the off-form concrete
                            walls of the service elements, the foyers feature glazing set in black
                            metal frames which extends the full height of the building. At the
                            ground floor level the glazing is vertical but above that for the
                            remaining two storeys it is sloping.
                        </p>
                        <p class="animate">
                            The building has concrete slab floors which are either carpeted or
                            finished in slate. Some interior walls are textured, off-form concrete
                            similar to the exterior. Other walls are lightweight partitions. There
                            is a mixture of ceiling treatments: off-form concrete, suspended
                            ceilings and set plasterboard. Many of the interior fitouts appear
                            relatively modern and are not original. The roof of the main building is
                            set behind a parapet and appears to be graded concrete with a membrane
                            coating.

                            The north wing replaces an earlier pavilion on the same location. The
                            current wing is a two storey structure with a flat metal deck roof set
                            behind a parapet. The wing has an encircling steel colonnade which
                            supports the roof and parapet. The walls are set back from the colonnade
                            and feature flush-mounted glazing set in thin black metal frames, with
                            textured off-form concrete spandrels, similar to the south wall of the
                            south wing. There is an enclosed link between the north and east wings
                            at the ground floor level.

                        <p class="animate">
                            The pool area is lower than the surrounding site, and being mostly
                            enclosed by the wings, has the quality of a sunken courtyard. The pool
                            area is reached by a large flight of concrete steps from the west, and
                            features a pond which borders a large, raised central island which is
                            reached from one side by a set of bridging steps. The island has
                            concrete paving, garden beds and silver birch trees, and is the location
                            for a large fibreglass statue of Sir Winston Churchill.
                        </p>
                        <p class="animate">
                            The carpark is constructed in off-form concrete, with walls displaying
                            the texture of the timber formwork. Churchill House has a number of
                            landscape/garden areas. At the front (west) of the building is an open
                            lawn area and either side are mixed native/exotic plantings. The pool
                            area contains numerous trees and shrubs, again of mixed native/exotic
                            species. A small courtyard to the southeast of the main building
                            features bamboo.

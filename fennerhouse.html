                            The Fenner House, at 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill, is located within
                            the Red Hill heritage precinct. It was designed by Robin Boyd in
                            1952–53 for Professor and Mrs Frank Fenner, and built by Karl
                            Schreiner in 1953-54. Professor Frank Fenner AC, CMG, MBE, FAA (21
                            December 1914 – 22 November 2010) was one of Australia’s leading
                            virologists, noted for his work on myxomatosis and smallpox, and has
                            won three of the world’s most prestigious awards: the Albert
                            Einstein World Award for Science (August 2000), the Japan Prize for
                            preventative medicine and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society
                            (London).

                        <p class="animate">
                            The house is one of Canberra’s best examples of the post-war
                            Melbourne regional style with its long unbroken roofline, widely
                            projecting eaves and large areas of timber framed glazing. It makes
                            an interesting comparison with the nearby Manning Clark House, also
                            designed by Boyd and which also has a glass walled entrance gallery
                            joining two wings of the house.

                            Clark House (1952), the Roche house in Bedford Street, Deakin
                            (1954), the W G Verge house at 204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1963)
                            and 12 Marawa Place, Aranda (1968–69).

                            The Fenner House at 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill, is listed on the
                            ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects Register of
                            Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. It is regarded by the
                            AIA as being a very good example of the post-war Melbourne regional
                            style with its large areas of glazing and vertical boarding, long
                            unbroken roofline, metal roof and raked ceilings.

                            The Fenner House represents a simple, bold, well planned and
                            designed house that appropriately integrates the building with the
                            corner block, set in a garden designed by important Canberra
                            landscape architect Professor Lindsay Pryor. The design of the house
                            was unique and advanced in Canberra at the time and is a significant
                            work of Robin Boyd, a prominent Australian architect.

                            academics at the Australian National University. The house was the
                            first winner of the Meritorious Architecture Award of the Canberra
                            Area Committee of the AIA in 1956.

                            The house is set well back diagonally on a large corner block that
                            slopes several metres from rear to front. The building consists of
                            two parallel, off-set wings facing north-north-east which represent
                            two living zones: the bedrooms, bathrooms and study in the rear wing
                            and the eating and entertainment areas in the front wing. The two
                            wings are linked by an enclosed, glass walled gallery.

                            The construction is double brick, with large areas of glazing in
                            full height narrow timber frames. The brickwork is bagged and
                            painted—grey on the north-south walls and white on the east-west
                            walls, both original colours. The area underneath the glazing is
                            painted in the original ‘celadon’ green colour. The roof is a long,
                            unbroken, low pitch gable with internally raked ceilings.

                            In 1982 a large extension was added to the western end of the rear
                            wing with a separate entrance off Torres Street. The extension was
                            designed by Canberra designer Bill Douglas with the intention of
                            being as close as possible in external appearance to the original
                            part of the house. The roofline remains unbroken and the detailing
                            of the eaves and glazing is identical to the original. At the rear,
                            the extended portion of the building is approximately 1 metre deeper
                            than the original rear wing.
